# Image Encryption and Decryption

This project implements a simple image encryption and decryption scheme using Python, the Python Imaging Library (PIL), and NumPy. The encryption process involves swapping pixel values and adding a constant to each pixel, while the decryption process reverses these operations.

## Features

- Encrypt images by modifying pixel values.
- Decrypt images to recover the original content.
- Simple and easy-to-understand implementation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pillow (PIL Fork)
- NumPy

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install Pillow numpy

## bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-encryption.git
cd image-encryption

## bash

python image_encryption.py
